 LTD_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "During the latter part of the 19th century this small nation has proven its resilliance on the world stage. However their decision to side with the Germans in the War to end all Wars has proven fatal for the small nation. As after the Treaty of Paris their formerly controlled region of the Alsace went back into French hands and the monarch went into exile leaving the country in a state of ambiguity. It is well known that the Germans plan to annex this state for themselves, meaning we need to be careful with every step we might take. The state of our armed forces aswell as the complete collapse of our economy have not exactly improved our situation."
 NIS_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Forming into a federation of islands back in the 18th century, this tiny nation north of Japan got subjugated amost immedeatly in the early years of the following century. With no real way to defend themselves against the Japanese, the Empire of the Rising Sun raided, pillaged and humiliated the citizens of Morokoro. Although a lot of time may have passed since then, the question of 'Can such deeds ever be forgiven?' still lingers in the minds of our people. The time has come, to ultimately decide if we accept the rule of our southern neighbor or if our future lies elsewhere. Perhaps then we could finally take back our future into our own hands."
